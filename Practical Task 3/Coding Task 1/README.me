# Recursive Factorial Calculator

## Description
This Python script calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive approach.

### Why it's important to learn:
Understanding recursion is crucial in programming as it provides a powerful way to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems. Recursion enhances code readability and efficiency for certain algorithms, although it requires careful handling to avoid potential pitfalls like infinite recursion.
