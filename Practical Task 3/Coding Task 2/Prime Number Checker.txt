#### Task Name: Prime Number Checker

**Description:**
This Python script checks whether a given integer is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The script uses basic looping and conditionals to determine the primality of the number.

**Why it's important to learn:**
Understanding how to check for prime numbers is fundamental in algorithm design and number theory. It involves efficient use of loops and conditionals, and can be extended to more complex algorithms such as prime factorization and cryptography.
